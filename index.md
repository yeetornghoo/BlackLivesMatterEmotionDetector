## Research Issues
Understanding Social Movement is not an easy task, where it consists of many possible factors. For a decade, researchers have been studying it from various point of view, like the social science, psychology, as well as data - to predict the start of the social movement. The topic remains challenging, due to the changes from the environment for example, Social Media that spread the information faster and specific topic being objectify and manipulate by some parties to influence the public opinion. Especially recently year more and more social movements occurring all over the world for various reason. Understanding the social movement emotion change motif is some interesting topic to be studied. By understanding the emotions along the social movement cycle, relevant parties can plan for the actions for negotiation and avoid the social movement escalated to another level. By making sense of the cycle it can be the baseline for other researcher to further the study on social movements, like predict the start, end, or even the change of the stage of the social movement cycle.
