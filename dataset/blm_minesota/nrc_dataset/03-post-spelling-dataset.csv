anger,"I do not get why a small #of protesters are burning down their city... ... but after Ahmaud Arbery & George floyd is murders, and Amy cooper is racist video; I know why blacks are pissed. I am pissed too &amp; have no clue what I can do to stop the racist assholes from my race"
anger,"Why are we ""thugs"" when it comes to fighting for a BLACK man is life but when your WHITE bitch ass does not want to wear a mask and waves a gun during a pandemic its ""reasonable"" ? Black lives fucking matter Karen, you do not need a hair cut you need to stop being racist. #blm"
anger,The has now filed third degree murder and manslaughter charges against former Officer Derek Chauvin in the May 25th death of George Floyd. Here is the full criminal complaint 1/2:
anger,"We can not look away nor remain passive. I am thankful that phone cameras exist, forcing us to confront longstanding racial injustice & brutality. I am overwhelmed, but my dispair is nothing compared to the horror we witness. We are better than this. #floydgeorge #BlackLivesMatter"
anger,"Racist policing makes Black immigrants disproportionately vulnerable to deportation on criminal grounds. Out in Yonkers with and our Queens brotha yelling #BlackLivesMatter and #NoHumanIsIllegal. Can't abolish ""police"" without abolishing ""ICE."""
anger,"George Floyd was a human being, a son, a father, so many things. got damn my heart hurts. fuck cops and you can unfollow me right fucking now if seeing fascists murder people does not make you furious too"
anger,"""there is no excuse for what happened to George Floyd — and justice will he served."" — Vice President Pence went on to say there is no excuse for violent riots and and that people responsible will be prosecuted to the fullest extent."
anger,broken glass can be fixed. damaged buildings can be fixed. george floyd CANNOT come back to life. Ahmaud arbery is death CANNOT be fixed. THE LIVES THAT HAVE BEEN STOLEN CANT BE REPLACED. SO STOP PLACING DESTRUCTION OF PROPERTY ABOVE THE DESTRUCTION OF HUMAN LIVES.
anger,Hearing lots of politicians denouncing the so-called agitators for turning peaceful protest into violent riots. How many of those politicians will denounce police for targeting peaceful protesters and press with violent thuggery? Plenty of video evidence. #GeorgeFloyd
anger,"Sickening, heartbreaking, and hateful are the 3 words that stick out to me after watching the death of George Floyd. This post by truly hit home. WE must CHANGE and do BETTER. This injustice and hate CANNOT continue. #GeorgeFloyd #ICantBreathe"
anger,"If you have spoken out against the riots more than the MURDER of #GeorgeFloyd by Derek Chauvin, you are part of the problem. Don't change the conversation right now. #BlackLivesMatter"
anger,"I weep for George floyd is murder. I weep for his family is loss. I weep for the violence gripping Minneapolis, our country, and the hearts of some within our own community. i am enraged by the systemic racism that continually fuels the senseless loss of life."
anger,Outside Albany Criminal Court stating our demands to defund police and end police brutality across the Capital Region!!! #BlackLivesMatter #DefundPolice #AllOfUs
anger,I HATE TRUMP SO MUCH WHY ARE PEOPLE LIKE THIS ?! SCREAMING AT PROTESTERS FIGHTING FOR EQUALITY. WHY SHOW UP TO A #BLM PROTEST AND DO THIS. FUCK TRUMP AND ANYONE WHO SUPPORTS HIM. #BlackLivesMatter – at Manasquan Inlet
anger,"Watching #protests2020 #riots2020, I am struck by the wisdom of those who have fought and continue to fight for human rights. By Desmond Tutu: ""My humanity is bound up in yours, for we can only be human together."" #GeorgeFloyd #DiversityandInclusion #BlackLivesMatter"
anger,"There have been a lot of white people on my TL who have been real silent about racial injustice, police brutality the death of George Floyd, etc...but all of a sudden are very vocal about condemning looting. what is more important to you? Property damage or systematic racism?"
anger,"The senseless deaths of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd and other victims of hatred, discrimination and intolerance against Black Americans in the country we call home are a striking reminder that our dedication to diversity and inclusion can not waver."
anger,"You have the right to protest peacefully without being shot at and tear gassed. You have the right, when accused of a crime, to a fair trial. You have the right to your LIFE. The injustice of our sinful world makes my heart so sick. #BlackLivesMatter"
anger,"If you are white and only post about riots and looting while ignoring the centuries of white oppression and killing of black people, your racism is showing. #BlackLivesMatter"
anger,"Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Stop attacking one another. If you do not like the views or beliefs of someone, UNFOLLOW THEM. We need to unite to fight for reform and justice, TOGETHER. Stop being hateful. Remember why you are fighting. #BlackLivesMatter"
anger,I have been reflecting on this heavily as i have watched dialogues occur about the protests in Mount Pleasant the last few days. What does it mean to denounce riots and celebrate police escorts at the very same event that is meant to protest the killing of George Floyd?
anger,"This is gonna sound mad nerdy but I invested in a few stocks that are known to go up during riots and chaotic times, they did, I cashed out, and now i am putting that money towards supporting the Black Lives Matter movement. I thought it would be a clever way to fight back"
anger,Saddened for George floyd is family &amp; the loss of their loved one. Saddened for those who have ever felt fear or intimidation due to the color of their skin. Saddened that the the narrative of a more unified future will be lost due to emotional &amp; violent riots. We are one
anger,"If you have said/posted NOTHING about the murders of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, or Breonna Taylor but want to start posting you are angry about the rebellion that happened last night....THAT is your answer as to why some people felt the need to escalate things to this level."
anger,"Trending narrative on social media: ""If you are more upset about the Minneapolis riots than you are about the about the police killing of George Floyd, then you are part of the problem"". Reality: You can be upset about both."
anger,"Been fighting this fight since the late 80s and elite liberal editors, executive producers, think tanks, politicians and donors can not be ones to set Black prioritization of victims of violence. I agree, ALL Black Lives Matter, not ones picked by distant politburos."
anger,"""All Cops are Bastards!?"" This is such bull shit, of course some are, but I know allot of great cops! when i think on how my friends that are good cops must feel with all this happening it makes me just as sad as when i see the George Floyd video. Fighting Hate with Hate."
anger,"Five days after Oakes Farms owner Alfie Oakes posted a rant to Facebook — calling BLM a ""hoax,"" calling George Floyd a ""thug,"" defending Derek Chauvin and saying protesters against racial injustice have ""no purpose"" — is cutting ties. On at 6 p.m."
anger,The death of #GeorgeFloyd was avoidable and unjust. I expected the anger and understand the anger. But this violent protest has gone too far when the death of this innocent man threatens the death of more innocent men and women. #Minneapolisprotests
anger,Who MURDERED GEORGE FLOYD. MURDERED. Stop dancing around it and call him what he is. A god damn murderer.
anger,"Some of the same businesses that were damaged by rioters Saturday night are posting #JusticeForGeorgeFloyd fliers over their remaining glass and boarded-up windows. Powerful, way to go #VictoryPark #BlackLivesMatter #GeorgeFloyd #DallasProtest #DallasRiots"
anger,"It pisses me off that it has taken a week of protest from millions of people across the country, both peaceful and violent, for these 4 sick, worthless thugs to be held accountable for killing George Floyd ON camera."
anger,"George Floyd was murdered by these policemen. I sit here angered, crying, wondering what the hell is going on, how do we stop this shit! They police should be convicted of murder and put away for good. There are too many good police, these are any of them!!!!!!"
anger,"Fuck Derek Chauvin. He is not ""MPD officer involved in incident."" He is a criminal, with a history of violence that escalated to murder. you are JUST A CROOK WITH A BADGE. NOTHIN BUT A CROOK WITH A BADGE. Justice for George Floyd."
anger,"I was watching the FB live video of the protest in East Peoria tonight. Which meant I sat through hundreds of despicable, RACIST comments from people who are more furious at black teenagers standing in a Wal-Mart parking lot than George Floyd being murdered. #BlackLivesMatter"
anger,"i have been consuming the content of these riots like i am watching an intense horror movie that I hate every moment of, but can not look away. #BlacklivesMater #GeorgeFloyd #Riots2020"
anger,Seeing people being more upset about the riots rather than the death of George Floyd tells me everything I need to know about you.
anger,Your president did not even acknowledge the murder of George Floyd until riots and looting began. Do with that information what you will.
anger,"""Shot to death"" George Floyd was not shot to death. There are different ways that people have been murdered. Also those statistics do not show context so they are completely irrelevant in this argument. Do better."
anger,Fucking Trump. Didn't even take a breath and pause to remember #GeorgeFloyd before bitching about the riots.
anger,"Dear trolls and racist individuals if you have not notice your hate comments, and death threats do not bother me. #BlackLivesMatter"

anger,"i have seen nothing but destruction, death, and division from #BlackLivesMatter. Grow up people!! We all matter! Stop the violence! You scream about injustice while you destroy innocent lives. We ALL must come together peacefully despite our differences. it is time!!"
anger,"i am screaming at how many white people were looking offended and were pointing when I wore my ""Black Lives Matter"" mask yesterday. Why does my want for equality make you uncomfortable?"
anger,"Tonight, along with Chief Noble of the YPD, the Town Board passed a resolution condemning the death of George Floyd and rejecting all forms of racism, discrimination and oppression."
anger,"I just watched the video of George floyd is murder, and there are not enough words to even describe the injustice that happened there. i am sickened and angry. We must use our voices to demand a change! Racism is real. We can not ignore it. #ChangeIsNeeded #JusticeForGeorgeFloyd"
anger,"Okay when it happens to others. Progressive Mayor Who Supported Black Lives Matter Gets Home Vandalized During Riots, Calls It ‘Domestic Terrorism'"
anger,"This is my dad. he is been with department for over 26 years. He, like most cops, are disgusted by the death of George Floyd. Now he is being dispatched to downtown Houston to work the protests/riots. I hate this shit."
anger,Nah. I saw morons and thugs. we are on the same side here. Just saying i am against senseless violence. Don't give a shit about skin tone. The death of George Floyd = senseless. what is happened in my city since = also senseless.
anger,My heart aches this morning as it has all week. The death of George Floyd has unleashed the destructive forces of racism which sets us against each. Moment calls forth even more that the world needs the moral leadership that is formed #leadership #service #excellence
anger,"i am from the South. that is not pride, it is hate. it is the same hate that lynched us for centuries, that killed Tamir Rice, that hunted and killed Ahmaud Arbery, that lynched George Floyd, and murdered and kicked Rayshard Brooks...call it by its name, white supremacy."
anger,"it is barely 7:30am and i have already gotten into it with a person denigrating George Floyd on FB. Slight work. An old, idiotic racist. I had boxed her in and was going for the kill shot posts to finish her when the poster who is threads we were fighting in deleted the post ."
anger,"Breaking news ! ""ALL the events of 2020 so far are planned ! The murder of George Floyd, COVID19, the force of the government making us wear masks, riots, looting. AND there is more to come just wait ! Hell until November !"" Source: My aunt in rural KS"
anger,"George, Ahmaud & Breonna in this moment are symbols of the inequity, systemic racism & inequality that blacks experience in this country everyday, in every sector. This is why we are seeing revolutionary revolt in the streets. #riots2020 #BlackLivesMatter"
anger,How does a 11pm curfew help with this YOU SHOULD HAVE LISTENED TO about the 7PM!!!! #StopTheRiots #StopTheViolence #StayAtHomeAndStaySafe #GeorgeFloyd
anger,"AmFamJack It is unbelievable — the #GeorgeFloyd incident and others is literally sickening and makes me so angry. We need to express our anger as an unwillingness to tolerate anymore in our communities, businesses and with our elected leaders. #icantbreathe"
anger,Definitely not more. They do not even compare. I AM upset that people think more hatred & destruction was the choice to fight for injustice. How is a stolen TV from Target or a burned down wendy is fighting for George Floyd?
anger,Have someone on your feed who has shared/tweeted about riots but not about the actual murder of George Floyd? it is probably a safe bet they are racist. Anyone who cares more about what happens to a Target than a human life has some soul searching to do.
anger,"A whole entire community of people can only take so much. Everyone has a breaking point, and at this point I do not even blame them for reacting violently. This shit hurts my heart, man. RIP George Floyd and all the others who have been victim to racist idealists."
anger,ALSO! fuck anyone who thinks the riots did not work. the murderers of george floyd were charged within like 2 days of a riot and breonna taylor is murderers have not even been arrested and it is only been peaceful protests
disgust,Holy shit. This coming from the woman who refused to hold a *single* officer accountable during her tenure as DA...including the officer that went on to murder George Floyd.
disgust,"i am physically feeling sick when I realize in what a cruel world we live in. George Floyd did not do a single thing wrong and they just took his life away like it is nothing. How are you able to do something so evil to a human, it just does not come to my mind..."
disgust,"tonight is peaceful protest was being protested by idiots like this lady. Long Island twitter, do your thing & let is find this lady. telling people to ""get over it"" in response to George floyd is death is DISGUSTING."
disgust,"Trump is jealous of George Floyd.... After he says Floyd is looking down at this great day, he says "" The fact that George Floyd had been held up as a martyr sickens me."" What a horrifying , little man!"
disgust,Derek Chauvin arrested. MN Attorney General Keith Ellison is taking over the George Floyd murder case FBI opens an investigation into the death of Breonna Taylor. Shit got flipped on its head and i am supposed to believe it would have happened if everyone just chilled?
disgust,You looters are disgusting losers. What a waste of life. Sad disgraceful generation who the F would be part of such a thing. LOSERS you people hv zero values or morals. This has NOTHING to do w #GeorgeFloyd just a bunch of punks. Gross #Anonymous
disgust,"the hatred you spew infects the weak-of-mind. On 11.03 we will administers the vaccine when we crush you, legally and peacefully. #BlackLivesMatter #VoteBlueToSaveAmerica2020"
disgust,I am sickened. Just saw a video of trump supporters taunting protesters at a BLM outside rally by lying down on their stomachs in a position george floyd died in. Now u see why I am serious when I say I am outta here if trump cheats back in. He and his arrogant magas r sick
disgust,Two docs who I highly admire believe that the autopsy of George Floyd was a misleading sham.
disgust,This ignorant racist called this guy a fat f*uck and the N word and got her ass handed to her. you are part of the problem and you are also a piece of shit. #BlackLivesMatter #EndRacismNow
disgust,This is why MGNA is offensive to us!!!! America was not great to George Floyd or Ahmaud Arbery in 2020. This same America was not great to Emmit Till in 1955.... America has never been great to blacks and it is sickening for our communities to have to live in fear. i am sick of this!
disgust,Oh finally you are here bitch! You got a dollar? So I can donate! you are fucking lying! Lemme see. OPEN YOUR PURSE! #BlackTransLivesMatter #blacklivesmatter
disgust,Jenna messercola gotta be the dumbest bum bitch to ever walk union catholic halls. dumb bitch has not said one thing about George floyd is death but can continuously spread this blue lives matter bullshit. bitch so fucking ugly inside and out.
disgust,"If you try to ""find dirt"" to convince yourself George Floyd was a bad person, you are absolute garbage. He was MURDERED."
disgust,Oh shit..... now that is motive. . #GeorgeFloyd #GeorgeFloydWasMurdered #GeorgeFloydProtests
disgust,"""I picked up a camera, because it was my choice of weapons against what I hated most about the world, including racism, intolerance and poverty."" Gordon Parks #GeorgeFloyd"
disgust,Trash Box is having a rally on Juneteenth? In Tulsa?! He really is a disgusting POS. #BlackLivesMatter #TulsaMassacre #DumpTrump
disgust,"Comparing the murder of George Floyd to ""shit happens"" is not a political opinion. it is blatantly racist and ignorant and deserves to be exposed."
disgust,i have never fully understood why Kap got so much hate for kneeling. Literally is what makes America great is that people can protest the oppressive government that holds them back. Seems kind of hypocritical to support one ammendment and not another. #BlackLivesMatter
disgust,I lost a lot of followers since George floyd is death. Feels good to get rid of you racist ugly fucks fuck you all and eat a fat dick shit head doo doo ass bitches
disgust,"Not all cops are pigs, or even half for that matter. The pigs are the shit eating individuals who abuse their power #GeorgeFloyd"
disgust,WHITE TRANS PORN STAR DANNI DANIELS HAS THIS TO SAY ABOUT #BlackLivesMatter hmmmmm thoughts? #BlackTransLivesMatter BLACK TERRORIST AGENDA? Smh wow the HATE IS SO REAL!
disgust,This is yet another disgusting show of racism & discrimination in Minneapolis. was more than graceful when he should never have had to been. He should have just been able to do his job. Has the city not learned from its murder of George Floyd? #FreeOmar #RIPGeorgeFloyd
disgust,I know i am back to shit posting on twitter but I swear to god if George floyd is murderer gets his charges dismissed i am lighting shit up
disgust,"The Proud Boys are pussy bitches, hiding behind disguised trying to disrupt peaceful protest. We know you are there. You am not proud. And you am not men. If you were you would stand up & counter protest. Chicken shit bastards. #BlackLivesMatter"
disgust,Ps I have my own views on political stuff but I keep that shit to myself. Everyone is entitled to their opinion on things. The #georgefloyd thing is despicable and made me sick. Justice must be served! But looting and claiming it is protesting is an absolute joke.
disgust,Absolutely sick over this disgusting act of murder. This needs to STOP! Sending prayers to his family and friends. #GeorgeFloyd #racism #thisneedstostop #JusticeForGeorgeFloyd
disgust,One of my dad is cousins just posted the most heinous comparison of looting to the murder of George Floyd saying they are equivalent and I told her it was heinous and disgusting and I do not even care if the family implodes that is just so disturbing.

fear,"People protest for #GeorgeFloyd in #Minneapolis #Minnesota Thousands of #NationalGuard troops patrolled major #US cities after protests over racism and police brutality boiled over into arson and looting, sending shock waves through the country. #BlackLivesMatter"
fear,"i have been reading about George Floyd, but trying to avoid the full video. The officer apparently felt threatened enough to continue choking a handcuffed man to death.... while also having his hands casually sitting in his pockets? These incidents never get any less sickening."
fear,"We may be on vacation but our conscience is not. it is not fair that we as a white family can travel in peace but a black American can not walk the streets without fear of dying at the hands of the police. ... ""Please, please, please, I can not breathe. Please, man."" #GeorgeFloyd"
fear,"Can't say I do not blame them, that was absolutely horrific, watching those cops MURDER George Floyd, was premeditated"
fear,"everyone is entitled to there own opinion so here is mine. what happened to george floyd is criminal, murder, and disgusting. but protesting by destroying innocent companies, businesses, and stores is not helping. protest the police not our cities. sad to see what our world is now"
fear,"1 i have spent time reflecting on mlk is 1963 work ""Letter from a Birmingham Jail,"" and Langston Hughes' 1947 poem ""Who But The Lord?"", and his 1951 poem ""Cafe: 3 A.M."" George floyd is death is not an aberration, but a continuation of a horrific and recurring injustice in the U.S."
fear,"Pres trump is tweet taken down: ""When the looting starts, the shooting starts,"" after threatening to send the military into Minneapolis. What do you think of this for leadership during our tragic crisis over George floyd is killing?"
fear,Black Lives Matter // hold cops accountable when they commit senseless murder // Listen to POC and be an ally // we need to create a better world for all people // stand up to our tyrannical fascist government // i am tired of seeing innocent people killed by pigs &amp; racist idiots
fear,My honest opinion... this guy should suffer the same fate as #GeorgeFloyd did. He should feel the same pain and agony of this unnecessary murder. I do not condone killing people but being taking into custody is not enough. An example must be set... prosecute him to the max!!!
fear,"you are kidding right? I mean come on. 1. The facts are in the pictures and videos... 2. Tragedies are always accidental and normally can not be prevented, so how is kneeling on #GeorgeFloyd ‘s neck for about 9 minutes a tragedy and not police brutality?"
fear,"Technically, yes. Another sad part of our history in nearly annihilating the Native American population for land and expansion. I pray that we will all learn from the George Floyd murder and make real change. That begins with the removal of the traitor in the White House. #FBR."
fear,"I just heard Rush Limbaugh say that the cop who killed George Floyd should be charged with first-degree murder and that the other cops standing around should also be charged. Everything is crazy, folks."
fear,"Agree with most of what you said. One exception. Black Lives Matter is NOT an innocent grassroots civil rights org to end police brutality. It is a well organized, well funded, international Marxist led effort to bring chaos and destruction of Western Civ."
fear,This! Leadership at its finest! #GeorgeFloydProtests #riots2020 #BlackLivesMatter #AntifaTerrorists #bostonprotest #neverdancealone #LosAngelesProtest #GeorgeFloydMurder #Riot2020
fear,I stand with George Floyd. I stand against the crooked cop. I stand against the by standers that let it happen. I sure as hell stand against these fucking criminals destroying the greatest country on earth. That is not protest.
fear,"Just the first of what will be many steps taken to ensure we are doing our part as Newhouse journalists and communicators to examine and combat the police brutality, systemic racism, and violence that plagues our country. More to come. #BlackLivesMatter"
fear,"A happy day for removing racist statue in front of our city hall; however, a HISTORIC day will be when Black Lives Matter more than statues,when police stop killing Black people and jailed for it,when body cams are released,when charges are dropped against protesters."
fear,What the HELL is this? Had George Floyd married into royalty before he was murdered? This man was a criminal with a long record- does he deserve this attention over Captain Dorn?
fear,"i fucking hate cops. fuck all cops, all cops are bad. black lives matter and always have. no one should ever have to walk around in fear for their literal lives. fucking death to all cops, complacent fucking jockeys. FUCK COPS FUCK COPS FUCK COPS ACAB"
fear,If you get mad at looting and rioting during Black Lives Matter protests just remember the South started an entire war over keeping their slaves and killed millions of Americans
fear,"it is times like these when we have to speak up, especially as people of color. george floyd was MURDERED. the police force in this country is corrupt, racist, and violent. we see the way they carefully treated whites carrying GUNS to protest social isolation. a man was accused1/?"
fear,You know what is fucked up? The riots and protests would stop IF THEY JUST PUT THESE FUCKING COPS THAT KILLED GEORGE FLOYD IN JAIL!
fear,I am glad to see that the officer that shot and killed #RayshardBrooks has been charged with Felony Murder. it is also been 97 days since #BreonnaTaylor was murdered in her own home. #NoJusticeNoPeace #HowManyMoreDays #DefendBlackLife #BlackLivesMatter
fear,"How do people think arson, vandalizing and stealing is a movement for ""protest"" for #GeorgeFloyd . that is a fucking criminal act and no way to get your word out about him if anything just disrespectful to him."
fear,"Remember reading about the Civil Rights Movement and thinking to yourself. Wow, how can people side w racists it is inhuman unAmerican. we are here now. Look at the Trump supporters, giddy as he threatens violence. #WeWereNeverGreat #AmericaOrTrump #DictatorTrump #BlackLivesMatter"
fear,"I finally forced myself to watch the torture and execution of George Floyd and now, yeah, I feel like I want to go out and burn down a police precinct. Or worse. Talk me down."
fear,Philly is on Fire Literally.Our Nation is so broken.The death of #GeorgeFloyd only adds to a litany of prior precedent &amp; unnecessary murder. Hate &amp; racism has become emboldened in this country. This is dangerous. This is NOT right. This makes me sick . We CANNOT IGNORE this.
fear,"One physical exam sign we note is labored or unlabored breathing, the effort of breathing. Any respiratory distress? it is a red flag of imminent danger. In COVID and the murder of George Floyd and all the protests, we see the long-standing distress and labored work of black ppl."
fear,"it is your white privilege that allows you to ""not be political"" when we are literally talking about how black people are being shot down/killed by the police. Check your privilege and acknowledge that black lives matter and black people do not deserve to be murdered by cops!"
fear,"For those that know me, i have defended this country and have had great opportunities being here. But i have also can remember walking in a park and worrying about #AnnCooper or seeing police and being nervous that a wrong move will get me killed like #GeorgeFloyd."
fear,So: Protesting = Ok when it is storming a State capital with AR15s because the government is actually trying to protect you. Protesting = Not Ok when it is minorities in the streets because the police are actually killing people. #doublestandard #icantbreathe #GeorgeFloyd
fear,"i am about to go to sleep, is the guy that killed ,#GeorgeFloyd in jail? Like how we get put in jail for minor crimes but end up there all fuckin weekend. Like a dui verses a murder. #minneapolisriots"
fear,"The black health crisis in Toronto is young black men with guns shooting and wounding/killing other black men almost daily, but #blacklivesmatter does not want you to talk about that. it is all white people is fault, of course. Black people have no control over their destiny,right?"
fear,So now George Floyd dying and us protesting police brutality is now an every black problem issue. An every injustice against any black person issue. that is what the responses to this have been.
fear,Oh just like an autopsy said George Floyd did not die from lack of oxygen .. oh wait ... it did. Just took a second autopsy because corrupt racist system cover up is a actual thing . FUCK these MURDERS may they rot in HELL.
fear,I feel bad for them they obviously fell victim to the Black Lives Matter movement a Marxist regime! playing on ignorance using the phrase Black Lives Matter to incite The African Americans to do their dirty work! risking black lives for the movement that is why they matter to BLM
fear,"No one in America should fear their government or police or be oppressed or persecuted by either. Racism has and does still exist and should be exposed, rejected and defeated. All are created equal, we must ensure all are treated equal. it is time to be kind. #GeorgeFloyd"
fear,"We should all be outraged at what the entire world has witnessed repeatedly on televised news cycles and social media outlets, resulting in stress and trauma for so many of our students, teachers, parents and community – the brutal murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota"
fear,So a tweet about my cat will get 100+ RTs but when I post about a #BlackLivesMatter or cops breaking windows and starting fires to justify violence against peaceful protesters screaming for justice...y'all just scroll on...cowards #JusticeForGeorgeFloyd #NoJusticeNoPeace
fear,Honor the memory of George Floyd with an arrest of all 4 of the officers. Not calling people thugs &amp; threatening a mass shooting.
fear,To say things like this passes off tragedies like #GeorgeFloyd as an anomaly. This ignores the systematic racism and oppression that led to this and cases like it.
fear,"the us looted the entire middle east and killed hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians and you expect me to get mad that a target, which funded the police department that murdered george floyd, got looted? okay sure"
fear,"it is really upsetting to me how many WHITE people i see avoiding commenting on george floyd is murder and the consistent and constant oppression and violence committed against black folks in this country. even when you do not tell us where you stand, WE KNOW."
fear,Just saying: I want every person involved with the George Floyd death to be prosecuted and punished to the farthest extent of the law.
fear,"People who want to talk about other criminal things George Floyd did during his life time, let us first talk about this: Ted Bundy, a white man and serial killer, brutally murdered at least 30 women, and escaped prison twice, but was not killed when captured either time."
fear,"The tides are turning. We marched down the streets of Jasper today, 22 years after the murder of James Byrd, to demand justice for George Floyd and other victims of police brutality. #TurnTexasBlue"
fear,"So George floyd is criminal accomplice who fled Minneapolis for Houston was arrested on 4 outstanding felony warrants for drugs, firearms, domestic violence. These poor crooks just can not catch a break."
fear,"There are news stories so revolting, it is impossible at 1:00am to sleep. The Minneapolis killing of George Floyd is unsettling in its cruelty. And yet—-over and over and over."
fear,"No, of course not. Quite the opposite. I respect them & realize that most of them put their lives in danger to protect all of us. I was replying to a mentioning about the 4 officers who were involved in George floyd is death. If they watched &amp; did nothing...that is horrible."
fear,"Amy Klobuchar had the chance to prosecute the killer that murdered George Floyd. In 2006 he murdered a Native American man named Wayne Reyes. Klobuchar chose not to prosecute him, and instead continued to let him terrorize Minnesota. George floyd is blood is on her hands too."
fear,"2020 in order, so far: Australia is on fire The Death of Kobe & Gigi Bryant Coronavirus pandemic begins Italy & other nations begin lockdown Kim Jong Un almost dies The Death of George Floyd The Riots/Protests"
fear,It probably sounds very hollow from my position of privilege but I need to say it. #BlackLivesMatter. Very much so. The pictures of police violence in the US are revolting. We know that racism exists everywhere incl Canada but it is frightening how openly it operates in the US
fear,"I will continue to stand up, speak up, and educate myself and others about the acts of hate and injustice against black people in the past and present. George floyd is life mattered as did the many other black men, women and children killed in America due to police brutality."
fear,What sparked the fire that led to you being forced to put out this statement was George Floyd being murdered by a cop. And then you thanked cops at the end of it. Awful
fear,"we are so desensitized to the plight of black people in America that stores are valued over our lives. This system is so corrupt that bringing cop brutality, power abuse, racism, & #BlackLivesMatter to our government was viewed as controversial topic. That peace is met with force"
fear,"Per Dr baden is independent autopsy, George Floyd died from compression of his neck and back So the 2 others on his back should be charged like Chauvin The watchdog cop should get accessory. He stood watch and would have attacked anyone trying save george is life."
fear,"The Black Lives Matter movement came out of the murder of black folks at the hands of the police. If we believe in abolition, more than being willing to die and martyr ourselves for the cause, we must be willing to live. Survival is a form of subversion. Existence is resistance."
fear,This is honestly really dumb. Be mad at the 4 cops responsible for what happened to George Floyd. They should all go to prison. But attacking random officers that have done nothing wrong is wrong especially when they are responding to a call possibly
fear,My heart goes out the family of George Floyd. And to the families of all those killed in these violent riots. And to the business owners who have had their hopes and dreams dashed by thugs and anarchists
fear,"I did not sleep well last night at all. The division and favoritism in our country is as clear as black and white. African Americans have been victims of injustice, police brutality and police murder for 400 years. The carnage continues unabated. #ChristianCooper #GeorgeFloyd"
fear,"Y'all. It helps. Hard writing today, worse reading-- 100k+ deaths from COVID, racism, George Floyd, people refusing to wear masks because they got to fight for their right to party... 1000 various punches in one go. Please: No advice--not trying to actually BE a cage fighter."
fear,i have always been cautious of the police but never scared. I thought this pandemic people would be safer and we would not be targeted but it does not seem that way. George Floyd deserved so much more.
fear,i am so ANGRY. & you all really wanna say racism does not still exist. huh???? WHAT! #BlackLivesMatter POLICE NEED TO STOP KILLING INNOCENT BLACK PEOPLE. i am so over thiS it is just RIDICULOUS at this point. that officer took a mans life over a CHECK?! THAT WAS NOT EVEN BAD??? WHAT!
fear,"ABC7 also used the term ""knelt on"" when describing #GeorgeFloyd killing. I never saw any type of retraction for that awful tweet."
fear,jUsT fOr OnE dAY u voted trump who called for the murder and shooting of black protestors. U can not come for solidarity for Black Lives Matter without recognizing all the grievances and trauma that led up to this moment.
fear,"i love unexpected messages from friends and family telling me to be safe and that they love and care for me . there is so much evil and cruelty being spread , and it is unsafe to even be out in public anymore . it is so scary and unhealthy . #BlackLivesMatters"
fear,My hometown is burning. A senseless act of violence led to absolute chaos and i am watching from many miles away with a very heavy heart. For #GeorgeFloyd. For all good people that do not deserve this amount of pain through visceral anger. Praying for peace.
fear,"Hi Mr. President. Are you aware George Floyd was murdered by a police officer a few days ago and there is no arrest? let is not forget about Ahmaud Arbery who was shot and killed a few months back. Also, there is a global pandemic going on. Do you not have something better to do?"
fear,"cops bought Dylan Roof burger king after he shot up a church, George Floyd was murdered for a suspected fake $20"
fear,"In 2006 you declined to prosecute a cop who had shot and killed a Native American man, murder. Derek Chauvin was that cop and he just murdered George Floyd. Resign."
fear,"When precious Black lives are lost so senselessly, i am often at a complete loss for words+am scared to say anything b/c i am terrified of saying the wrong thing-White silence speaks volumes+ perpetuates the problem. White silence is violence. We have to speak up! #blacklivesmatter"
fear,#GeorgeFloyd was not the only to die from being arrested in this way saw video of a white guy. it is not as simple as racism. it is giving cops and government too much power. Police must be help accountable for their actions abuse must be called out regardless of race
fear,nightmares turned to dreams & i told death i am not scared of you #BlackLivesMatter #BLACKFUTURESMATTER
fear,"First, a pandemic. Then, the unrest following the murder of George Floyd. Add two hurricanes before the season even started. And now this 7-footer just watched me cut the grass for an hour, waiting for me to slip! Thank you, 2020! You can go now!... Please!! #EnoughAlready"
fear,Watched the video of George Floyd being murdered. I truly am disgusted. I can not think of a situation that would make this necessary. Unless this man was literally running around killing people... was he??? I know all police officers are not this way. But this is just fucked.
fear,i am truly in AWE of the things that are going on in the world right now. it is truly baffling that we are not only living through a pandemic but we are too watching our black brothers and sisters die due to police brutality. i am sick to my fucking stomach. #GeorgeFloyd
fear,Why is the coward w a badgewho killed George Floyd not in jail? Why is the coward w a badge who stood there and watched the other man kill George Floyd not in jail. Why did it take 75 days we know the answer-video to arrest Ahmaud arbery is murderers? We all know why.
fear,i am about to lose my f*ing mind. People who were ABSOLUTELY SILENT about George Floyd now expect me to weigh in on the riots. So I will not mince words: destruction of property is in no way close to being the same as someone entrusted to protect people killing a man on the street.
fear,"last week i spoke up and asked that my abuser is name be removed from an open letter to our high school administration about their failure to adequately address the murder of George Floyd. it was scary, but racial justice and support for survivors go hand in hand"
