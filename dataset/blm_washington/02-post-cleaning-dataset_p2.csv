I saw a black guy rob a store and shoot a black cop 5 times and left him to dye. After 8 surgeries he returned to duty. The cop was protecting the neighborhood. That was on body cam. I also saw George Floyd’s murder which was equally horrifying. Lots of great cops,I saw a black guy rob a store and shoot a black cop 5 times and left him to dye.
