I once read a powerful book about human loss-what stuck w/me is this-studies have shown that humans cry out for their moms just before they die. It’s universal. Dying soldiers have been known to do this. George Floyd was clearly unaquivaclay battling for his life.,I once read a powerful book about human loss-what stuck w/me is this-studies have shown that humans cry out for their moms just before they die.

Black Lives Matter. But the movement that bears the name does not focus on black on black violence which kills far more black people than the police. A missed opportunity IMO. Solve this and police violence will also go down. And less families will suffer. ,Black Lives Matter.

The signs that get me most at these protests are “Am I Next?” Members of the black community believe they could be the next George Floyd.

I’m at the point now I’m so disgusted with what I’m seeing I could care less about George Floyd and what happened to him because no one seems to care about the destruction of our cities.
