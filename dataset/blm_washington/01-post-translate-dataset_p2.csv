I saw a black guy rob a store and shoot a black cop 5 times and left him to dye. After 8 surgeries he returned to duty. The cop was protecting the neighborhood. That was on body cam. I also saw George Floyd’s murder which was equally horrifying. Lots of great cops,I saw a black guy rob a store and shoot a black cop 5 times and left him to dye.

Comparing these 2 cases is irresponsible and awful reporting. George Floyd was murdered by a bad cop the same can’t be said for Marcus. You will do anything to garner praise from the mob.

There is no way anyone was going to take away their right to protest after George Floyd &amp; I don't blame them one bit. I'm proud of each and every one &amp; wish I could be there.,Yeah.

So Derek Chauvin worked with George Floyd and didn’t like him. Now Chauvin may face 1st Degree Murder charges. Good. Only issue - this elevates the whole “few bad apples” argument. Yes MPD hired a racist asshole but Chauvin never killed any other black people. This was personal. ,So Derek Chauvin worked with George Floyd and didn’t like him.
