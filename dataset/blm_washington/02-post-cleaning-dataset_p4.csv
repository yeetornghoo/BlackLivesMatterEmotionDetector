"Officer Chauvin committed first degree murder is because he has has his hands in his pockets. He can show us that he is not touching him but in fact, he is using his hand to push his leg down harder on George Floyd’s neck. That was intentional murder. #JusticeForGeorgeFloyd","Officer Chauvin committed first degree murder is because he has has his hands in his pockets.
