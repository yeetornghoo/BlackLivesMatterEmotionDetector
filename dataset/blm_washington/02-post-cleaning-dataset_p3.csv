What happened to George Floyd is inexcusable. I believe that racism unfortunately still exists and that’s sad to say. There should be protests about the unjust taking of Black Lives. Posting pictures of someone who was fired doesn’t help ease tension,What happened to George Floyd is inexcusable. I believe that racism unfortunately still exists and that is sad to say.

The thing bothering me most is that White people don't understand that the riots & protests aren't just about the murder of George Floyd. It's about years & years of mistreatment of Black people in our country. They are fed up & White people just don't get it. #BlackLivesMatter,The thing bothering me most is that White people don't understand that the riots & protests aren't just about the murder of George Floyd. it is about years & years of mistreatment of Black people in our country.

@realDonaldTrump the reason people are upset is because 3 men help to kill a man on video and haven’t been arrested. It took months to arrest a dad &amp; son who killed a runner on the streets.
