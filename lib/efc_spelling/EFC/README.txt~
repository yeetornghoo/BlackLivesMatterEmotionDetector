### EXTRACTED SPELLING ERRORS ###
If you use the spelling errors in your work, please also cite:
Lisa Beinborn, Torsten Zesch, Iryna Gurevych. Predicting the Spelling Difficulty of Words for Language Learners. In:Proceedings of the 11th Workshop on Innovative Use of NLP for Building Educational Applications held in conjunction with NAACL 2016, p. to appear, 2016. 

The file spellingErrors.csv contains all errors in the corpus that have been annotated with the tag "SP". The files filteredSpellingErrors.csv, spellingErrorProbabilities.csv and tokenfrequency_all.dist have been obtained after pre-processing the data as described in Beinborn et al. 2016.

The folder SpellingErrorsbyL1 contains subsets of the spelling errors filtered by the L1 of the learner (Brazilian Portuguese, Mexican Spanish, Chinese, German and Russian). 

The folder "TrainTestData" contains the training and test data for the experiments described in Beinborn et al. 2016. 

We would be happy, if you let us know when using the spelling errors for further research:
